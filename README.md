## About Nicholas Noone

I am a sophomore attending Tennessee Technological University, pursuing a major in Computer Science (CSC) with a concentration in Cyber Security and Information Systems. I grew up in Warwick, New York, and found computers and programming piqued my interest from a young age, leading to where I am today. I moved to Tennessee about four years ago, and ever since, I've grownâ€”not only as a comp sci major but also figuratively (like 10 inches; I used to be super short).
